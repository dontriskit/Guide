# Upscaling: Removing the jpg damage and artifacting from an image

Upscaling/Hiresfix are the same method. Upscaling is normally done in another UI called ComfyUI, while Hiresfix is pretty much the same exact thing, minus a couple small settings.

To get a good upscale model, you can use the [DeJpeg Ultra Fatality](https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-DeJpeg-Fatality-PlusULTRA) on OpenDB. There's also plenty of other models there to try like [SuperScale](https://openmodeldb.info/models/4x-NMKD-Superscale)

Hiresfix is a small tab that comes with your A1111 UI, it will be in the text2img tab and you will be able to choose from a variety of different settings once it's enabled.

Denoise will select how much of the original image is used when you upscale the image. I normally set mine to 0.42, then the upscale amount to 1.5x so we don't blow the image proportions up too much, then I like to use 10-20 hires steps.

I hope this helps you to find decent settings for your upscaling purposes on A1111!
