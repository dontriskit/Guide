# Embeddings: An Incredibly Powerful Tool In A Small Package

Embeddings, also known as textual inversions, are small model files you can find on [Civitai](https://civitai.com/) that are used in the prompts for Stable Diffusion.

When you download an embedding file from Civitai, you can put it into stable-diffusion-webui/embeddings in order to use it

The trigger word you use to activate it along with any other instructions should be on the respective creator's page for the embedding on Civitai.
