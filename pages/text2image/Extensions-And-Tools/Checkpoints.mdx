# Checkpoints: The Default Model Of Stable Diffusion

Checkpoints have been around for over a year. Originally we kept them in a .ckpt file format, some are in .pickletensors, while the majority nowadays are in a .safetensors format.

You can find Checkpoint files on [Civitai](https://civitai.com/), although HuggingFace also has some checkpoints like [BreakDomainR](https://huggingface.co/Cooper/breakdomainrealistic/blob/main/breakdomainrealistic_R2333.safetensors)

Once you download a model, you can put them into the stable-diffusion-webui/models/stable-diffusion folder

Once you load up A1111, these models will show up in a dropdown list in the top left corner.

If you'd like to learn how to train checkpoint models, then I would recommend checking out [Olivio Sarikas' video](https://youtu.be/j-So4VYTL98?si=2sqmeEs2sGJG3rCL).
