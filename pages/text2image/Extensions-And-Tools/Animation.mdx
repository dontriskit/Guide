# Introducing Deforum: Frame-by-frame animation with A1111

I've worked with Deforum for months, it's something that is incredibly fun to pursue. [Here is one of my videos that I made with it](https://youtu.be/TlN2PNH_Nec?si=zLTKUahU00uYT1m_).

If you'd like to try making videos like these for yourself, then you can start by reading [HarroweD](https://civitai.com/user/HarroweD)'s guides, like I did. He's worked with Deforum as one of his primary tools for a long time, and he taught me a lot of what I know, today.

[Guide #1](https://civitai.com/articles/554/dwh-1-creating-your-first-animation-with-deforum-in-1-click)
[Guide #2](https://civitai.com/articles/606/dwh-2-animating-your-own-images-with-deforum)
[Guide #3](https://civitai.com/articles/627/dwh-3-how-to-schedule-your-animation-parameters-to-change-during-the-render)

Then, when I finished with reading these and experimenting, I moved on to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bicPayZDI60) and practiced what I learned from it.

Once I finished all of these things, I was more than ready to learn my own fun techniques, as I'm sure you'll feel, too! If you'd like some more information about how I specifically craft my works, or perhaps would like to learn about other A.I. animation software, [here is a link to the advanced animation guide!]
