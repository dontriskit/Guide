# Free Lunch with ChenyangSi

This is an interesting provision from Chenyang, they seem to have created a way for us to manipulate the Unet through the WebUI of Stable Diffusion models.

You can read about it and what it does [here](https://chenyangsi.top/FreeU/).

If you'd like to add it to your webui then you can navigate to the extensions tab in A1111 and then add it via URL, then reset your browser and terminal when it's finished. The [link for the A1111 implementation is here](https://github.com/ljleb/sd-webui-freeu)
