# A Guide to Automatically Fixing and Improving Hands + Faces

One gigantic problem with A.I. art is that it often messes up on small details in the face, and with the hands. There are a couple of ways that we can go about helping this, and we will cover all that I know in this site.

## Adetailer - automatically inpaint hands and faces...along with anything else you can think of.

Adetailer is an extension developed by BingSu, and it focuses on automating the process of healing errors within a portrait image. You can find the code for it [here](https://github.com/Bing-su/adetailer)

In the A1111 WebUI, there is an extensions tab, you can click this, and then click install from URL, and drop the link to the code into the box. Hit Install, wait for it to finish intalling, and then restart your terminal and browser.

Once your UI is reloaded, you should have a small tab titled "Adetailer"...you can now select a model for your adetailer units, which will tell it what to inpaint. yolovn face will inpaint faces, while yolovn hand will inpaint hands. You can prompt the positive and negative fields with just about anything: LoRA, embeddings, or just plain regular tokens.

In this small reading, we discussed how to install and use Adetailer, this should overall benefit your production quality greatly, feel free to read further into the pages of this site for more advanced, powerful tools for you to use.
