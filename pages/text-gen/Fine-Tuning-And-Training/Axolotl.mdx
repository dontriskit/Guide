# Axlolotl: Your Key to Fine-Tuning LLms

Axolotl is an open-source software program that allows for QLoRA, a vastly inexpensive method for fine tuning a model...as well offering full-parameter methods.

The difference between QLoRA and LoRA or full parameter training is that QLoRA only trains a very small amount of parameters on your data. This makes QLoRA amazing for training on different styles, or if you just want to give it a few niche concepts.

I prefer full parameter training because you have a much better chance of giving the model more real-world capabilities this way.

You can even lightly contaminate your training with DPO in order to further push the capabilities of your model.
