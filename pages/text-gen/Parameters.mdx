# Parameters: A Huge Confusing List of Settings

With Oobabooga, you are given a parameters tab. In the parameters tab, there is another big page of tabs to be scrolled through. The main one we will focus on here is the Generation tab.

In the Generation tab, there are numerous sliders, boxes, and different settings to tweak. If you wish to just read about Oobabooga parameters as they were written...[access this page, and read about them, here.](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/wiki/03-%E2%80%90-Parameters-Tab)

Kalomaze has also written up an article/guide to the parameter "min-p" which he designed himself. I think it would be most appropriate to let him tell you about that [here on the github page he made, for it](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/27670)

Mainly, I just use the parameter preset "simple-1" when I am testing models and comparing, but I would like to offer some key things to consider, as well as [a link to a list of parameters and what they do](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/wiki/03-%E2%80%90-Parameters-Tab)

Temperature: I set this ~1 in order to test how the model performs when not affected by parameter adjustments.

Top P: At default, this will be set to about 0.9 in oobabooga. When Top-P is not set to a value of 1, you are essentially distorting the output of the model. At a value of 1, and with added other settings we'll go over, you will get undistorted outputs.

It's good to note that some models might do better if you distort the outputs, so feel free to test and learn what works best for your use-case.

top_k: I keep a low top_k as well, I find that values anywhere from 20-40 should produce coherent outputs. For storywriting I actually can set mine as high as 128 on some models.

repetition_pentalty : Setting this too high will cause the model to make more mistakes than it is worth, so I either turn it all the way down to 1 or leave it at the default 1.15

I really don't touch any other settings on my end, as this allows for me to ask the model questions, and have it write articles, for me.

I hope this short guide, and the included links helped you learn more about parameters in oobabooga!
