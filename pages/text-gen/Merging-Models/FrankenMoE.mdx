# FrankenMoE: MoE, With Random Routing

Mergekit had an update awhile ago, that makes it capable of creating Sparse Mixture of Experts models. In a Sparse Mixture of Experts, you call upon different models throughout a singular output to average the best question between them.

So, the model looks a lot larger, but really you're not inferencing with that much, normally it's an 8x7B, so you're only ever using 2 7B models at once. [It's easier if you read about it here](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe), as it's a pretty complex thing to explain.

I call this a frankenMoE because in [my merges](https://huggingface.co/Kquant03/Buttercup-4x7B-GGUF) the router is not trained with the experts like in a proprietary model. I will keep this page updated, in case there's a method found to fix this.

For these models, you want to prompt for what you want each model to be responsible for within the resulting MoE, like so:
