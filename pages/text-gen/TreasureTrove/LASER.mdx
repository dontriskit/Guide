# LASER: Reducing Redundancy in Models 

LASER (Layer-Selective Rank Reduction) is a method that kills parameters in order to help the model focus only on the desired bits.

There is documentation for it, as well as the code for it, on [its github repository](https://github.com/pratyushasharma/laser).
