# Oobabooga: A User-Interface For Inferencing Language Models

Oobabooga is a software program that offers the function of inferencing, along with training, and even evaluation. There are better stand-alone programs for training such as axolotl, and the EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness is fantastic for evaluating models. As for inferencing, there are two main UI's we will touch upon, on this site. This guide is dedicated to getting oobabooga set up and showing you how to use it.

### Step 1: Download or clone the repository

[Download the repo here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or [visit oobabooga's github](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui). 

### Step 2: Install it.

**Linux:** `start_linux.sh` in terminal once you have it into a preferred folder.

**Windows:** run the `start_windows.bat` file.

**Apple:** `start_macos.sh` in terminal once you have it in your preferred folder.

**WSL"** `start_wsl.bat` from terminal once you have it in your preferred folder.

### Step 3: Select GPU

It will give you a list of graphics cards to choose from. Type the appropriate letter response and hit enter.

### Step 4: Wait

It will eventually spit out a link for you to use: "http://127.0.0.1:7860/" will be the right one. If you want to change it, you can call --port in the commandline arguments.

### Finished.

That's all! You can go to the models tab, and there will be a place to put [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models) links. Make sure it's a valid repository (it will give you an error if it's spelt wrong or something). Click download once you paste a good repository you'd like to have in the box.

On the parameters tab, while we wait...There's a lot of stuff to explore, some of which is relatively complex if it's the first time you've seen it. I will handle that stuff in another guide, for now, I want you to check and see if the model you downloaded says what template it uses ,on the model card. If you can figure out what prompt/instruction template the model uses...you can go to the parameters tab, hit instruction template, and you can find the right one from a list of presets...or you can play around with random ones, some of them are outdated and will not work with modern models, though. They are preserved for research purposes.

Once your model is downloaded, navigate to the chat tab and scroll down, a bit. You should see 3 check boxes, one saying "chat", one saying "chat-instruct", and one saying "instruct".

For fun, you can use chatmode, but it's recommended to use instruct mode, or chat-instruct mode, for work-related/academic purposes.

I hope this guide helped you to get ooba set up in an easy to understand, and simplistic way. Have a nice day, and feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
