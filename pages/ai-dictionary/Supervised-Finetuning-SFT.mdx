## Supervised Finetuning (SFT)

Supervised finetuning (SFT) is a method of fine-tuning a model using labeled examples. In other words, the model is trained on input-output pairs, where the input is a prompt and the output is the correct response. This allows the model to learn the mapping between prompts and responses, improving its ability to generate accurate and relevant outputs.
